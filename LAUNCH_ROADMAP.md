*Focus: Essential user interactions (Edit, Delete, Manual Override) + backend freeze init*

#### Frontend (2.5 hrs)
- [X] Add **Edit Habit Modal** (edit name, description, settings)
  - Reuse CreateHabitModal as template
  - Call PATCH `/habits/{id}` endpoint
  - Show success/error feedback
  
- [X] Add **Delete Habit Button & Confirmation Dialog**
  - Red button at bottom of card
  - "Are you sure? This cannot be undone." modal
  - Call DELETE `/habits/{id}` endpoint
  - Refresh habit list on success

  - Button appears only if `allow_manual_override=true`
  - Time picker dialog (hours: 0-23, minutes: 0-59)
  - Submit as manual log entry to backend
  - Show success confirmation

- [X] **Reorganize Card Buttons** (consistent layout):
  ```
  [Mark Complete / START] [View Stats] [Edit] [Delete]
  ```
  - All in one row (flex wrap if needed)
  - Consistent sizing and spacing

#### Backend (0.5 hrs)
- [X] Initialize **2 Freezes per Habit** at creation
  - ✅ Added `freezes_remaining` field to Habit model (default: 2)
  - ✅ Updated POST `/habits/` to initialize with 2 freezes
  - ✅ Created Alembic migration & applied to database
  - ✅ Updated `use_freeze()` endpoint to decrement per-habit freezes
  - ✅ Updated `get_habit_stats()` to return habit.freezes_remaining

- [X] Implement **Manual Log Creation Endpoint**
  - ✅ Created `create_manual_log(db, habit_id, duration_min, notes)` in crud.py
  - ✅ Added `ManualLogCreate` schema for request validation
  - ✅ POST `/{habit_id}/logs` endpoint returns HabitLog response
  - ✅ Tested via Swagger - time entry, notes, and streak updates working

---

### **Day 2: Danger Visual System & Account Settings**
*Focus: User safety feedback (In Danger colors) + account management*

#### Frontend (2.5 hrs)
- [X] **Implement "In Danger" Color System**
  - Use `HabitStatus.color` + `HabitStatus.in_danger` from backend
  - Card border glow colors:
    - 🟢 Green: Completed today
    - 🟡 Yellow: Pending, safe (early in day)
    - 🟠 Orange: In danger (late in day, not completed)
    - 🔴 Red: Missed (missed yesterday)
    - 🔵 Blue: Frozen (streak freeze applied)
  - Update card CSS classes dynamically
  - Show warning badge "⚠️ In Danger" on card
  
- [X] **Freeze Counter Display**
  - Show "❄️ X freezes" on all cards (updated dynamically from stats)
  - Backend auto-consumes freezes on skipped days
  - Freezes earned automatically at 7 and 14 day streaks (no button needed)

- [X] **Account Settings Page**
  - New route: `/settings`
  - Display current email
  - Change password form (current + new password)
  - Delete account button with double-confirmation
  - Freeze balance display (earned freezes from user level)

- [X] **Settings Navigation Link** (in app header)

#### Backend (0.5 hrs)
- [X] Per-Habit Freeze System Complete
  - ✅ `freezes_remaining` initialized to 2 on habit creation
  - ✅ Automatic freeze consumption on missed days (Day 1-2 of skip)
  - ✅ Day 3 of skip = streak death (no exceptions)
  - ✅ Freeze earning at 7-day streak (+1, max 2)
  - ✅ Freeze earning at 14-day streak (+1, max 2)
  - ✅ All test cases passing (54/54 ✅)
  - ✅ Removed deprecated user.freeze_balance
  - ✅ All endpoints return freezes_remaining

### **Day 3: Polish, Testing & Deployment Setup**
*Focus: Production readiness, deployment configuration, store assets*

#### Frontend (1.5 hrs)
- [ ] **Undo Mark Complete (60 sec window)**
  - After "Mark Complete" is clicked, show "Undo" button for 60 seconds
  - Card stays green during undo window
  - Click "Undo" reverts to incomplete state, shows "Mark Complete" again
  - Auto-reverts to normal after 60 seconds expire
  - Backend: DELETE /habits/{id}/undo-complete endpoint

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - Create `.env.production` with backend API URL
  - Update API service to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`
  - Test against production backend URL
  
- [ ] **Error Boundary Component**
  - Wrap app in error boundary
  - Display friendly error messages
  - Add "Report Bug" button
  
- [ ] **Loading Placeholders (Skeleton Screens)**
  - Habit card skeleton during load
  - Stats modal skeleton during fetch
  - Smoother perceived performance

- [ ] **Mobile Testing & Tweaks**
  - Test on iPhone Safari (iOS)
  - Test on Android Chrome
  - Fix any layout breakage
  - Verify touch interactions (no hover-only features)

- [ ] **Create PWA Manifest** (mobile install support)
  - `public/manifest.json` (update icons, name, theme color)
  - Add to home screen capability

- [ ] **Final UI Polish**
  - Consistent spacing across all components
  - Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
  - Dark mode consideration (defer if tight on time)

#### Backend (0.5 hrs)
- [ ] **Fix Timezone Bug** (Deferred from Day 2)
  - Backend currently uses UTC for all day boundary calculations
  - Problem: User in EST (-5 hours) sees different calendar day than backend
  - Solution: Use user's browser local timezone for `get_percent_of_day_elapsed()`
  - Impact: Fixes color aging (yellow→orange→red transitions) accuracy
  - Test: Verify habits transition colors at correct local time boundaries

- [ ] **Update CORS** for production domain
  - Add your final Vercel frontend domain to allowed origins
  - Remove localhost restrictions
  
- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - Database URL (managed by Railway)
  - JWT secret (strong, random)
  - CORS domain configuration
  - API documentation URL

- [ ] **Deploy to Railway** (free tier)
  - Connect GitHub repo
  - Set environment variables
  - Verify all endpoints working
  - Load test (basic)

#### Google Play Store Prep (1 hr)
- [ ] **Create Google Play Developer Account**
  - Pay $25 one-time fee
  - Complete company/identity verification
  
- [ ] **Build APK/App Bundle**
  - Generate signed release build
  - Create app signing key
  
- [ ] **Prepare Store Listing**

## 📝 Further Recommendations & Future Considerations

### Recommended Future Additions (Priority Order)

#### Tier 1 (Month 1)
- **Habit Archive** instead of hard delete (ability to restore)
  - Backend: Add `archived: bool` to Habit model
  - Frontend: Show "Archive" instead of "Delete", add archived filter
  
- **Notification Reminders**
  - Per-habit notification time (e.g., "Remind me at 9 PM")
  - Requires push notification setup (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
  - Low priority if no users request

- **Avatar & Profile Customization**
  - User avatar upload
  - Display name (vs email)
  - Bio/about section

#### Tier 2 (Month 2)
- **Social Features** (optional, lowers privacy guarantee)
  - Friend/group habits
  - Habit sharing (view-only mode)
  - Leaderboards (top streaks)
  - **Risk:** Significantly increases backend complexity

- **Advanced Analytics**
  - Weekly trend charts (line graph)
  - Monthly summary (bar charts)
  - Consistency score (% of days completed)
  - Time-of-day heatmap (when are you most productive?)

- **Gamification**
  - XP system (points for streaks)
  - Level progression
  - Badges (7-day, 30-day, 100-day, never_froze, etc.)
  - **Warning:** Can become a distraction; keep it simple

#### Tier 3 (Month 3+)
- **AI/ML Features** (higher server cost)
  - Predictive completion reminders
  - Habit recommendations based on user patterns
  - Motivation quotes based on mood
  
- **Integration with External Services**
  - Apple Health integration
  - Google Calendar integration
  - Strava integration for fitness habits
  - **Complexity:** High; consider third-party SDKs

- **Offline-First Architecture**
  - Local data sync when online
  - Works without internet
  - **Complexity:** Significant refactor

---

### Features to Possibly Skip (Keep it Simple)

❌ **Not Recommended for v1:**
- Multi-profile support (one user per account is fine)
- Habit sharing groups
- In-app messaging/chat
- Wearable integration (Apple Watch, Fitbit)
- Gamification point system (too distracting)
- AI coach feature (too complex, needs NLP)
- Habit prediction algorithm (premature optimization)
- Cryptocurrency/blockchain rewards (unnecessary, adds complexity)

**Why skip these?** They add surface area for bugs, increase backend cost, and dilute core functionality. Launch simple. Add based on *user request*, not speculation.

---

### Backend Architecture Notes

**Current Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI (async, performant)
- SQLAlchemy ORM (database-agnostic)
- PostgreSQL (managed by Railway)
- alembic (migrations, version-controlled)

**Scalability Considerations (not needed for v1, but good to know):**
- Current in-memory session handling is fine for < 10k users
- For millions: Consider Redis for session caching
- For millions: Add database read replicas
- For millions: Add CDN for frontend (Vercel already includes)

**Monitoring** (recommended even for v1):
- Sentry (error tracking, free tier generous)
- LogRocket (session replay, helps debug user issues)
- PostHog (product analytics, privacy-first)

### Deployment Recommendations

**Frontend Hosting:**
| Platform | Pros | Cons | Cost |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Vercel** | Next.js native, auto-scaling, Analytics | Limited to Vercel ecosystem | Free tier generous |
| **Netlify** | Same as Vercel, great UX | Same limitations | Free tier generous |
| **Firebase Hosting** | Google ecosystem integration | Lock-in | Free tier small |

**Recommendation:** **Vercel** — Best developer experience, auto-deploy from GitHub, generous free tier.

**Backend Hosting:**
| Platform | Pros | Cons | Cost |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Railway** | Simple UI, good docs, FastAPI ready | Limited free tier (500hrs/month) | Free tier with pay-as-you-go |
| **Fly.io** | Global deployment, Kubernetes native | Learning curve | Free tier small, then pay |
| **Render** | Auto-deploy, simple, free tier | Slower cold starts | Free tier tiny, then paid |

**Recommendation:** **Railway** — Best middle ground for small to medium apps, clear pricing.

### Cost Estimate (First Year)

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Google Play Account | $25 (one-time) | Registration fee |
| Vercel (frontend) | $0/month | Free tier sufficient for < 100k users |
| Railway (backend) | $0-20/month | Free tier: 500hrs compute + $5 per GB database. ~$10/month typical startup. |
| Domain name (.com) | $12/year | Namecheap, not required for store launch |
| **Total First Year** | **~$70** | Extremely cheap for a production app |

## 📞 Support & Feedback Loop

**Post-Launch:**
- Monitor Google Play reviews (respond to feedback)
- Set up email support (support@habittracker-app.com)
- Join indie app communities (Indie Hackers, ProductHunt)
- Ask users what features they want before building

**Don't:**
- Build features nobody asks for
- Get lost in perfectionism
- Add encryption/security features prematurely
- Rebuild from scratch

## 🚀 Final Motivation

You're shipping a **real, production app** in 3 days. That's amazing.

The fact that your backend is 86% test-covered, well-architected, and ready means you're not rushing—you're executing. Launch now, perfect later.

Ship. Iterate. Listen to users.

**You've got this.** 💪
