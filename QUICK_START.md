# Quick Start - Backend Integration Complete ✅

## What's Been Set Up

Your React habit-tracker-ui is now fully connected to the habit-tracker backend API!

### ✅ Completed:
- [x] API service layer (`src/services/api.js`) with all endpoints
- [x] Authentication context (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- [x] LoginPage with signup and login modes (`src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`)
- [x] CreateHabitModal for habit creation (`src/components/CreateHabitModal.jsx`)
- [x] App fetches real habits from backend
- [x] HabitCard with timer-based and manual tracking
- [x] Real-time timer display with elapsed time
- [x] Manual completion with "Mark Complete" button
- [x] Logout functionality
- [x] Error handling and loading states
- [x] Beautiful responsive UI styling
- [x] Environment configuration

## Quick Start

### 1. Make sure your backend is running
```bash
# In your habit-tracker repo:
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
# Should be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 2. Start the React app
```bash
npm start
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Create a test user (if needed)
```bash
# POST to http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### 4. Create a test habit (if needed)
```bash
# POST to http://127.0.0.1:8000/habits/
# (requires authentication token)
{
  "name": "📚 Learn Programming",
  "description": "Practice coding daily",
  "is_timer": true
}
```

## How to Test the Integration

1. **Sign up** using the LoginPage:
   - Click "Sign up" if you don't have an account
   - Enter email and password to create account
   
2. **Create some habits**:
   - Click "+ New Habit" button
   - For timer-based habits (checked "Use Timer"):
     - Click START to begin a session
     - Watch timer run in real-time
     - Click STOP to end session
   - For manual habits (unchecked "Use Timer"):
     - Click "Mark Complete" to check off for today
     - Shows ✓ confirmation
     
3. **View your habits**:
   - All habits appear in a responsive grid
   - See your current streak on each habit
   - Active timers show elapsed time

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "Cannot read habits"
→ Make sure backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### "401 Unauthorized"
→ Need to implement authentication (see BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md)

### Timer not updating
→ Check browser console for errors

### CORS errors
→ Ensure backend has CORS configured for `http://localhost:3000`
